# LARBS
This is my modified version of lukesmithxyz's auto-rice bootstrapping scripts.
I made some changes which can be found mainly in the progs.csv.
This also installs all needed dotfiles from my .dotfiles repository.

## Essentials
To get this script working you need a base installation of arch.
There is no need to configure users or anything else than internet access and what is needed to get arch booting.

- Operating System: ```Arch Linux```
- Window Manager: ```i3```
- Shell: ```zsh```
- Terminal Emulator: ```zsh```
- File Manager: ```vifm```
- Application Launcher: ```dmenu(_run)```
- Compositor: ```xcompmgr```
- Status Bar: ```i3blocks```
- Notification Service: ```dunst```
- Text Editor: ```nvim```

## Installation
```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiynger/larbs/master/larbs.sh
sh larbs.sh
```
