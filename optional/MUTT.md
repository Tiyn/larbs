# Mutt
These are a bunch of programs to be able to use lukesmithxyz's mutt-wizard,
which will be able to setup your neomutt acordingly.

| program     | description           |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| neomutt     | mail program          |
| isync       | syncs mail            |
| msmtp       | sends mail            |
| pass        | encrypts passwords    |
| mutt-wizard | autoconfigure neomutt |

After this you will be able to:
``` mw add ``` to add mailaccounts
``` mw ls ``` to list existing ones
``` mw pass ``` to revise passwords
``` mw delete ``` to delete accounts
``` mw purge ``` to delete all accounts and settings
``` mw cron ``` toggle a cronjob to sync mail
